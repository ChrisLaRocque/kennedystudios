          <hr>
          <p>We've been lucky enough to know the members of Weakened Friends for more than a decade now. The collection of bands our staff have been in have played with every variation of Weakened Friends' former bands as well as being lucky enough to have played with the Maine power trio on more occasions than we can remember.
            <br><br>
            When we started our video session series Weakened Friends were one of the first bands that came to mind on our dream list and we were honored they made the drive to come play for us.
